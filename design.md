# The Desing for the Apriori & FP-Tree & Grouth mini project
<p>Analyzing panels to recommend products on real data.</p>
Context : we have an E-com dataset of sales data, each line corresponds to a product sold in a transaction. The goal is to recommnd products to clients based on the Algorithms : Apriori & FP grouth.

<bold>If a client buys Product A, He also usually buys Product B then.</bold>

</ln>

<h3>Steps : </h3>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Transactional Data set from Raw Data : CSV...</li>
    <li>Apply Apriori and FP-Grouth to extract frequent Itemsets and associations between those itemsets.</li>
    <li>interpret the results using measures like : Support, Confidence, lift.</li>
    <li>make recoomendations based on the associations</li>
    <li>make a compairason of Apriori vs FP-grouth including algorithm execution time, number of extracted laws of associations, read times ...</li>
    <li>Finally visuallize the assocaitions using matplotlib </li>
</ol>
